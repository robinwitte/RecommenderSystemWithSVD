# RecommenderSystemWithSVD
 Using singular value decomposition as a matrix factorization approach

 The task of a recommender system is to recommend items, that fit the user's taste. The approach, that makes use of only user activities of the past, is termed collaborative filtering. Given a not fully specified user-item ratings Matrix, a collaborativefiltering algorithm estimates robustly all missing entries. This project describes a collaborative filtering algorithm, that uses singular value decomposition (SVD) as a form of matrix factorization. The approach is based on Simon Funk's method, which was invented for the Netflix-Challenge (http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html).

 The mathematical description of the method can be found in the PDF-File. The code is written in a Jupyter notebook.
